"""
The core module provides the base class for AvoPlot elements, which are used to
represent the hierarchy of plots - i.e. a figure may contain many subplots, a
subplot may contain many data series etc.

The element framework is designed to cope with the fact that many different 
components of the GUI may modify plot elements and all of these components
will need to be notified of the changes. For example, a figure may be renamed 
by using the right-click menu on the its tab in the plots panel. It can also
be renamed using the navigation panel - both of these panels need to be notified
when the name of a figure gets changed. The way this is implemented is as 
follows: the panel doing the renaming calls figure.rename_element(). This 
changes the name of the element and generates an AvoPlotElementRenameEvent. Both 
the plots panel and the navigation panel handle this event and use it to update 
their appearance. Adding and deleting elements works in a similar way.
